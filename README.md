</div>



!


## Overview

Smart Farming Assistant is an innovative solution that uses advanced technology to help farmers improve productivity and make better decisions. The platform features a Smart Crop Recommendation system powered by machine learning to suggest optimal crops based on soil nutrients, climate, and historical data. It also includes a Plant Disease Identification tool using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately diagnose plant diseases from uploaded images, enabling timely intervention. Additional features such as real-time Weather Forecasts, tailored Fertilizer Recommendations based on soil quality and crop requirements, and a Smart Farming Guide for crop management further enhance its value. With a user-friendly web app, farmers can easily access these insights and tools to improve farming practices.

## IOT Overview
We developed an IoT-enabled device that integrates into the soil and continuously monitors essential soil and climate parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

The collected data is sent to a cloud server, where it is processed and fed into a Machine Learning model. The ML model analyzes the real-time soil-climate conditions and provides personalized crop recommendations to the farmer, ensuring maximum yield and sustainability.

Farmers can access insights through a mobile/web app or SMS alerts, which display:

- [x] **IOT**: Features an intuitive platform for farmers to easily input data and receive personalized crop, disease, and fertilizer recommendations.



## Datasets

The **Smart Farming Assistant** project provides three key datasets: the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** (2200 rows) includes soil and environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorous, temperature, humidity, and pH to predict the most suitable crops; the **Plant Disease Identification Dataset** contains 70,295 training and 17,572 validation images covering 38 diseases across 14 crops like Apple, Tomato, and Grape, used to train CNN models for disease detection; and the **Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset** offers data on soil quality and crop needs to provide tailored fertilizer suggestions.

# ðŸ“Œ Crop Recommendation Model

The **Crop Recommendation Model** utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest the most suitable crops for farmers based on environmental and soil factors. By analyzing data such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the model provides tailored crop recommendations to ensure optimal growth and productivity. The model uses seven classification algorithms, with **Random Forest** achieving the highest accuracy of 99.55%. This helps farmers make informed decisions on crop selection, ensuring better yields and efficient farming practices.

## Dataset

This dataset consists of **2200 rows** in total.
**Each row has 8 columns representing Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, PH, Rainfall and Label**
NPK(Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) values represent the NPK values in the soil. Temperature, humidity and rainfall are the average values of the sorroundings environment respectively. PH is the PH value present in the soil. **The Label column tells us the type of crop that's best suited to grow based on these conditions.
Label is the value we will be predicting**


## Model Architecture
 
For the Crop Recommendation Model, seven classification algorithms were utilized to predict suitable crop recommendations. These algorithms include:

- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (achieved the best accuracy)
- XGBoost
- KNN
  
Each algorithm was trained on a dataset comprising various factors such as soil nutrients, climate conditions, and historical data to provide accurate crop recommendations to farmers.

## Integration

These two models are integrated into the Smart Crop Recommendation System with Plant Disease Identification. This system provides farmers with comprehensive support, offering both crop recommendations based on various factors and precise identification of crop diseases through image analysis. By combining these models, the system enables farmers to make informed decisions, optimize crop selection, and effectively manage plant diseases for sustainable agriculture and enhanced productivity.

## Results

- Seven classification algorithms were evaluated for crop recommendation tasks.
- The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the highest accuracy of 99.55%.
- Table 1 below illustrates the accuracy achieved by each algorithm:
